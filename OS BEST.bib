  abstract = {This paper examines whether a firm's financial performance (FP) is associated with superior environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores in emerging markets of multinationals in Latin America. The study addresses the current research gap on this issue; it develops hypotheses and tests them by applying linear regressions with a data panel drawn from the Thomson Reuters Eikon\texttrademark{} database to analyse data on 104 multinationals from Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru between 2011 and 2015. The results suggest that the relationship between the ESG score and FP is significantly statistically negative. Furthermore, in examining environmental, social and governance separately to accurately determine each variable's relationship to multilatinas' FP, the results reveal a negative relationship. Finally, the empirical analysis provides evidence for a moderating effect of financial slack and geographic international diversification on the relationship between ESG dimensions and firms' FP. This study furthers understanding of the relationship between ESG dimensions and FP for the Latin American business context.},

  abstract = {With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has experienced economic and social fragility, which calls for alternative approaches to navigate towards sustainable outcomes. While recent studies show that responsible investments (RI) are resilient during the economic downturn caused by crises such as COVID-19, there has been little exploration into exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Using ANOVA and multivariate regression models, we analyze the differences and relationship between the financial returns of ETFs and their Eco-fund ratings during the COVID-19 pandemic-related financial market crash. Our results indicate that higher levels of the sustainability performance of ETFs do not safeguard investments from financial losses during a severe market downturn. These results contribute to the research by exposing weaknesses of current sustainability scores and rating methods to provide an initial analysis of RI during the COVID-19 pandemic},

  abstract = {Gaining a better understanding of the behavior of international investors is key for informing the debate about the optimal response to capital flows and about reforms to the international financial architecture. In this context, recent research on the behavior of international mutual funds at the micro level has expanded our knowledge about the drivers of portfolio flows and the mechanisms behind the transmission of financial shocks across countries. This paper provides a brief survey of this literature, with a focus on the empirical evidence for emerging markets. Overall, the behavior of international mutual funds is complex and overly simplistic characterizations are misleading. However, there is broad-based evidence for momentum trading among funds. Moreover, funds tend to avoid opaque markets and assets, and this behavior becomes more pronounced during volatile times. Portfolio rebalancing mechanisms are clearly important in explaining contagion patterns, even in the absence of common macroeconomic fundamentals. From a surveillance point of view, this implies that monitoring the exposures of large investors at a micro level is crucial to assess vulnerabilities.},

We find that balanced portfolio allocations by professional investors, considered in this study, closely align with the traditional 60/40 policy for asset allocation. Furthermore, we provide strong evidence on the existence of an equity home bias for investors from all four regions whereas evidence on the bond home bias tends to be equal to or stronger than for equities, however less robust across considered models. Moreover, we report a negative relation between the level of implied risk aversion and the degree of home bias and conclude that the degree of foreign asset allocation decreases in an increase of risk aversion. Finally, findings in this study indicate that about 80-90\% of an investors total return can be attributed to the strategic allocation with a strong impact of economic conditions on the asset class allocation of investment professionals around the world.},

  abstract = {We merge portfolio theories of home bias with corporate finance theories of insider ownership to create the optimal corporate ownership theory of the home bias. The theory has two components: (1) foreign portfolio investors exhibit a large home bias against countries with poor governance because their investment is limited by high optimal ownership by insiders (the ``direct effect'' of poor governance) and domestic monitoring shareholders (the ``indirect effect'') in response to the governance and (2) foreign direct investors from ``good governance'' countries have a comparative advantage as insider monitors in ``poor governance'' countries, so that the relative importance of foreign direct investment is negatively related to the quality of governance. Using both country-level data on U.S. investors' foreign investment allocations and Korean firm-level data, we find empirical evidence supporting our optimal corporate ownership theory of the home bias.},

  abstract = {Theoretical arguments suggest that as the degree of a country's home bias increases, the global risk sharing between domestic and foreign investors will reduce and thereby increase the country's cost of capital. Consistent with this prediction, we find international differences in the cost of capital to be strongly and positively related to varying degrees of home bias for 38 markets. This finding is robust to different cost of capital proxies, different control variables, alternative home-bias measures, international tradability of stocks, and alternative specifications. Therefore, the overall evidence implies that countries may enjoy a significantly lower cost of capital by reducing the extent of their home bias and hence, increasing global risk sharing.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the motives, behavior, and characteristics shaping mutual fund managers' willingness to incorporate Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues into investment decision making. Using survey evidence from fund managers from five different countries, we demonstrate that this predisposition is the stronger, the shorter their average forecasting horizon and the higher their level of reliance on business risk in portfolio management is. We also find that the propensity to incorporate ESG factors is positively related to an increasing level of risk aversion, an increasing importance of salary change and senior management approval/disapproval as motivating factors as well as length of professional experience in current fund and increasing significance of assessment by superiors in remuneration. Overall, our evidence suggests that ESG diligence among fund managers serves mainly as a method for mitigating risk and is typically motivated by herding; it is much less important as a tool for additional value creation. The prevalent use of ESG criteria in mitigating risk is in contrast with traditional approach, but it is in line with behavioral finance theory. Additionally, our results also show a strong difference in the length of the forecasting horizon between continental European and Anglo-Saxon fund managers.},
